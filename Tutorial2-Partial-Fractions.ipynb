    "The method of partial fraction decomposition is a useful tool for evaluating integrals of rational functions, and it comes up in other contexts as well, such as the method of Laplace transforms for differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem (which one quickly discovers) is that determining the coefficients for a partial fraction decomposition can be an exercise that is both tedious and error-prone. The brute force method (equating coefficients and solving a system of equations) is not particularly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it turns out that partial fractions are going to be a part of your life, then you'd like to be able to handle them quickly and accurately. You have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let the computer do it for you\n",
    "2. Develop systematic methods (formulas, even!) to get the job done\n",
    "\n",
    "You explored the second option on your assignment. Now, we'll see how the computer implements those methods for us."
