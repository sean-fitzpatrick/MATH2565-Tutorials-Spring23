    "## Arc length and numerical integration\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two goals for this tutorial assignment:\n",
    "1. Understand how to use the arc length formula\n",
    "2. Learn how to manipulate arrays and set up numerical integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The second goal is closely tied to the first: most of the integrals that result when the arc length formula is applied cannot be evaluated by hand. We will begin by introducing arc length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f(x)$ be a function that is differentiable on a closed interval $[a, b]$. (For the meaning of differentiability on a closed interval, see [Section 2.1 in the textbook](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-accelerated/sec_derivative.html#subsection-7).)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **arc length** of the curve $y=f(x)$, for $a\\leq x\\leq b$, is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}\\,dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument for this formula is quite clever: we partition the interval $[a, b]$ using points\n",
    "$$x_0=a\\lt x_1 \\lt \\cdots \\lt x_n=b,$$\n",
    "and approximate the curve by the *polygonal path* passing through the points $(x_i, f(x_i))$, for $i=0,\\ldots, n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of each segment is given by the distance formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta L_i = \\sqrt{(x_{i+1}-x_i)^2+(f(x_{i+1})-f(x_i))^2} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x_i)^2 + (f(x_{i+1})-f(x_i))^2} = \\Delta x_i\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{f(x_{i+1}-f(x_i)}{x_{i+1}-x_i}\\right)^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, by the Mean Value Theorem, on each interval $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$, there exists some $c_i$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(c_i) = \\frac{f(x_{i+1})-f(x_i)}{x_{i+1}-x_i},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "giving us $\\Delta L_i = \\Delta x_i \\sqrt{1+(f'(c_i))^2}$. Putting this into a Riemann sum, we get our formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trouble is that for all but the most carefully chosen curves, the arc length formula results in an integral that is impossible to evaluate symbolically. (Have a look at the functions that appear [in the exercises for Section 7.4](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-accelerated/sec_arc_length.html#exercisegroup-146)!)"
