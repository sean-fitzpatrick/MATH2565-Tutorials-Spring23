    "# Math 2565 Tutorial 11: Polar curves\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polar coordinates** provide us with an alternative coordinate system for the plane. Instead of a rectangular grid system, we fill the plane with circles centred at the origin. We can locate any point on the plane by first specifying a circle (given by its **radius** $r$), and then saying where on that circle we are, using an angle $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram of the polar coordinate system](polar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trigonometry gives us the relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}x&=r\\cos(\\theta) & r^2&=x^2+y^2\\\\ y&=r\\sin(\\theta) & \\tan(\\theta)&=\\frac{y}{x}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike rectangular coordinates, polar coordinates are not uniquely defined, due to the periodic nature of the sine and cosine functions. For example, the polar coordinates $(4,\\pi/3)$, $(4,-5\\pi/3)$ and $(4, 7\\pi/3)$ all decribe the same point, with rectangular coordinates $(2,2\\sqrt{3})$. By convention, we allow $r$ to be negative, and interpret this as moving *backwards* along the line through the origin corresponding to the angle $\\theta$. This is the same as rotating by an angle of $\\pi$ and moving forwards, so, for example, the coordinates $(-4,4\\pi/3)$ also describe the same point as the rectangular coordinates $(2,2\\sqrt{3})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most curves are defined in polar coordinates by giving $r$ as a function of $\\theta$ ($r=f(\\theta)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if $c>0$ is a constant, $r=c$ is a circle of radius $c$. $r=0$ is the origin $(0,0)$, which is the only point where no angle $\\theta$ can be defined\n",
    "- if $r=\\theta$, we get further and further from the origin as $\\theta$ increases, and the result is a spiral\n",
    "- the equation $r=\\sin(\\theta)$ describes a circle! This might not be obvious at first, but if we multiply both sides of the equation by $r$, we get $r^2=r\\sin(\\theta)$. In rectangular coordinates, this is $x^2+y^2=y$, and by completing the square, we can write this as $x^2+\\left(y-\\frac12\\right)^2=\\frac14$\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other (really cool) curves can be created using different functions of $\\theta$, many of which would be difficult to describe in rectangular coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting polar curves\n",
    "\n",
    "When plotting an equation $r=f(\\theta)$ by hand, we try to imagine moving our pen further from (or nearer to) the origin as we vary $\\theta$, depending on whether $f(\\theta)$ is increasing or decreasing. We can manage some limited success this way, but again it is easier to defer to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programs (both GeoGebra and SymPy included) do not have a built in polar plotting utility. This is because any polar curve $r=f(\\theta)$ can be treated as a parametric curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}x&=r\\cos(\\theta)=f(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\\\ y&=r\\sin(\\theta)=f(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta)\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So to plot a polar curve, we first convert it to parametric, and then use the same `plot_parametric` function from SymPy as we used in the previous tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to plot the curve $r=\\sin(5\\theta)$, with $0\\leq \\theta\\leq \\pi$, we would do the following:"
