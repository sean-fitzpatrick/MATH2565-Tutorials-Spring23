    "# Math 2565 Tutorial 10: Parametric curves\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a **parametric curve** is given by equations $x=f(t), y=g(t)$, for $t$ in some domain (often a closed interval $[a,b]$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using parametric equations allows us to define a wide variety of curves that would be impossible to define using the graph of a function, or an implicitly-defined function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main things we are interested in with parametric curves are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to plot them (this is mostly a job for the computer)\n",
    "2. How to convert (when possible) between \"rectangular\" curves like $y=x^2$ or $\\frac{x^2}{4}+\\frac{y^2}{9}=1$ and parametric curves. (Converting from rectangular to parametric is called \"parametrization\", and there is no unique answer for this. Converting from parametric to rectangular is called \"eliminating the parameter\".)\n",
    "3. Calculating tangent and normal lines to parametric curves, and determining if a curve is \"smooth\"\n",
    "4. Calculating arc length (this is mostly a job for the computer)\n",
    "5. Calculating area bounded by closed curves (this is the topic of Assignment 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to plot parametric curves using SymPy and GeoGebra, and you will calculate arc length symbolically (using SymPy) and numerically (using NumPy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting Parametric curves with SymPy\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for plotting a parametric curve in SymPy is `plot_parametric((expr_x,expr_y),range)`, where `expr_x` is an expression that defines $x$ in terms of our parametric (most likely `t`), `expr_y` is an expression that defines $y$ in terms of the parameter, and `range` defines the domain for the parameter, using the same syntax as for integrals. For example, for $t\\in [1,3]$ we would use `(t,1,3)` for the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can plot more than one curve on the same set of axes by including an ordered list of curves: for two curves, you would have something like `plot_parametric((expr_x1,expr_y1),(expr_x2,expr_y2),range)` if the range is the same, or `plot_parametric((expr_x1,expr_y1,range1),(expr_x2,expr_y2,range2))` for different ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional arguments include `line_color` for the colour of the curve, `label`, `xlabel`, and `ylabel` to label the plot, $x$ axis, and $y$ axis, respectively, and `xlim`, `ylim` to set the bounds for the $x$ and $y$ axes (equal to an ordered pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example, which plots the sine and cosine functions from $-2\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:"
