    "# Tutorial 6: Systems of differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's activity takes us a bit beyond what is covered in the textbook, but not too much beyond!\n",
    "\n",
    "As side benefits, we get an early introduction to parametric curves, and some reminders about the utility of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus will be **coupled systems of autonomous differential equations**. The context is the following: we have two variables $x$ and $y$ that both depend on an independent variable $t$ (our parameter, which in many contexts can be viewed as time).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a coupled system, the two quantities $x$ and $y$ change in time, but they also influence each other. An example would be sales numbers at two competing stores: the more that store A sells, the less store B sells, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with **linear** systems, of the form\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\frac{dx}{dt} &= ax+by\\\\ \\frac{dy}{dy}&=cx+dy\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "for constants $a,b,c,d$. (In a more general linear system, $a,b,c,d$ could be functions of $t$, but we will stick to the time-independent case to keep things simple.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will end with a classic example: a **predator-prey** model, where we have two animal populations: a prey species, that if left untouched would experience exponential population growth, and a predator species, whose population growth (or decline) depends on the size of the prey population. This is a **non-linear** system, and we will not be able to understand all the details at this point, but we can still explore it both graphically and numerically."

As $t$ increases from $a$ to $b$, we can imagine a point that moves in \"time\", tracing out a curve.\n",
